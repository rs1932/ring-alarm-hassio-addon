# ring-alarm-ha-integration
HASSIO addon based on the excellent work done by https://github.com/tsightler/ring-mqtt
No code changed from that plugin.  <br /> 
Docker has nodeJS, git (for pulling the source code) and npm <br /> 

The config parameters mimic the same parameters as in tsightler's code to make it simpler.
